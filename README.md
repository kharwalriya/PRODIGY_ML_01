House Price Prediction with Linear Regression
Welcome to the House Price Prediction project repository! This project was successfully completed during my internship at Prodigy, where I implemented a linear regression model to predict house prices based on their square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms.

Project Overview
The goal of this project was to develop a predictive model that could accurately estimate the prices of houses using key features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms. This task required data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation to ensure accuracy and reliability.

Key Tasks and Achievements
Data Collection and Cleaning: Gathered housing data from reliable sources and performed data cleaning to handle missing values and outliers.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted EDA to understand the relationships between variables, identify patterns, and gain insights into the dataset.

Feature Engineering: Created relevant features such as total area (combining square footage of all rooms) to improve model performance.

Model Development: Implemented a linear regression model using Python and machine learning libraries such as Scikit-Learn.

Model Evaluation: Evaluated the model using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared to assess its predictive performance.
